# NewsApp_Stage_2

## Project name: The Pigeon Letters

## Description:

This project was created as a part of the Android Basics Nanodegree and for Google India Scholarship Challenge 2k18. The goal of this project is to add a Settings Screen to the News Feed app made earlier in [News_App_Stage_1](https://github.com/RB-93/NewsApp_Stage_1.git) which will allow users to narrow down the stories displayed in from the feed.
* In this project, I have worked on two preferences options namely:
  - topic category as Relevance
    > _**Search by**_ preference: to narrow down the news stories according to the search keyword. 
  - publishing time as Newest first
    > _**Sort news by**_ preference: to narrow down the news stories with newest on top.
   
## Focus:
* In this project, the required change is Settings screen for the News Feed app, this functionality can be accessed from the Settings <a href="#"><img src="app-demo/Ic_settings.png" width="12" height="12" /></a> icon (in the top-right corner of <a href="app-demo/News_2[1].jpg?raw=true" width="250" height="450">News List</a> Screen.
